# Code format

Easy to perform code format on the templates of Regularjs.

## Usage

Two manners are included in this extension, choose either of them according your requirements:

1. Right click on the partially selection of your template string then choose the option `Format Selection with...` then choose `Regularjs` on the list of the popup panel.

   Although this way is a little inconvenient but he specific comment `<!-- @regularjs -->` is not required via this way.

2. Call out the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) then choose the `Format Document with...` then choose `Regularjs` on the next popup panel. 
  
   `<!-- @regularjs -->` is required to be presented in every template you want them to be handled automatically.
